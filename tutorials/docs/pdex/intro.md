Description: Introduction to a new version of pDEX: pDEX v3
---

Incognito [has recently introduced a new version of its pDEX](https://we.incognito.org/t/introducing-the-new-pdex-pdex-v3/13026) with the promise of addressing the obstacles of the old (and somewhat inefficient)
instance, and the centralized Provide.

In this category of tutorials, we'll explain newly-introduced terms (when encountered) and show how to use the SDK to manipulate with the
new pDEX. Basically, the category is divided into the following sections:

* [Querying the pDEX](./query.md)
* [NFT Minting](./nft.md)
* AMM Liquidity
  * [Contribution](./contribute.md)
  * [Withdrawal](./withdraw.md)
  * [LP Fee Withdrawal](./lp_fee_withdraw.md)
* Order Book
  * [Adding an Order Book](./ob_add.md)
  * [Canceling an Order Book](./ob_cancel.md)
* AMM One-sided Liquidity (Staking)
  * [Staking](./stake.md)
  * [UnStaking](./unstake.md)
  * [Withdrawing the Staking Reward](./staking_reward_withdraw.md)
* [Trading](./trade.md)
