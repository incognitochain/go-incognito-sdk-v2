Description: Tutorial on Portal terms and functions
---

In this tutorial, we will cover the description of some the Portal terms and functions.
# Terms

### Shielding 
Users who want to use the Incognito platform for private transactions have to deposit (a.k.a. shield) their current tokens from external chains to the corresponding private tokens in Incognito

### Shielding addresses
Shielding addresses are multi-sig addresses generated by a combination of a chain-code input from users (e.g, payment addresses, deposit public keys)
and master public keys from the Beacon committee. Each chain-code is 1-1 mapped to a unique shielding address.

### UnShielding
Un-shielding is the process of withdrawing private tokens from the Incognito network and releasing them to the public blockchains. 

### DepositParams
DepositParams consists of parameters for creating a shielding transaction. This struct is used in the [newly improved one-time depositing addresses](https://we.incognito.org/t/work-in-progress-one-time-shielding-addresses/15677).
The description of a DepositParams is as follows:
```go
// DepositParams consists of parameters for creating a shielding transaction.
// A DepositParams is valid if at least one of the following conditions hold:
//	- Signature is not empty
//		- Receiver and DepositPubKey must not be empty
//	- Signature is empty
//		- If Receiver is empty, it will be generated from the sender's privateKey
//		- If DepositPrivateKey is empty, it will be derived from the DepositKeyIndex
//		- DepositPubKey is derived from DepositPrivateKey.
type DepositParams struct {
	// TokenID is the shielding asset ID.
	TokenID string

	// ShieldProof is a merkel proof for the shielding request.
	ShieldProof string

	// DepositPrivateKey is a base58-encoded deposit privateKey used to sign the request.
	// If set empty, it will be derived from the DepositKeyIndex.
	DepositPrivateKey string

	// DepositPubKey is a base58-encoded deposit publicKey. If Signature is not provided, DepositPubKey will be derived from the DepositPrivateKey.
	DepositPubKey string

	// DepositKeyIndex is the index of the OTDepositKey.
	DepositKeyIndex uint64

	// Receiver is a base58-encoded OTAReceiver. If set empty, it will be generated from the sender's privateKey.
	Receiver string

	// Signature is a valid signature signed by the owner of the shielding asset.
	// If Signature is not empty, DepositPubKey and Receiver must not be empty.
	Signature string
}

```
