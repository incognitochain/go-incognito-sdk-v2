# Portal Bridges
The Incognito side-chain can be attached to any blockchain to conduct confidential asset transfer â€” this time, we consider Portal, 
a general solution for building trust-less bridges to UTXO-based blockchains, and it is now currently supporting BTC. 
Portal removes the need of a centralized backend for shielding/un-shielding BTC. 
With Portal, users directly manage to deposit their BTC (to) or withdraw their BTC (from) Incognito at any time they want 
without having to send it to a temporary address generated by the Incognito backend. 
This hugely improves the UX and makes it available to perform bridging tasks on other platforms (e.g, Incognito CLI) instead of 
relying solely on the Incognito apps. Furthermore, [one-time addresses](https://we.incognito.org/t/work-in-progress-one-time-shielding-addresses/15677) 
are also employed when shielding to address the problem of shielding address re-using.

For more information, check out [The Trustless Non-custodial Bitcoin Bridge](https://we.incognito.org/t/shipped-incognito-s-trustless-non-custodial-bitcoin-bridge/9605), 
and [One-time Shielding Addresses](https://we.incognito.org/t/work-in-progress-one-time-shielding-addresses/15677).

In this category of tutorials, we'll explain Portal terms (possibly when encountered) and show how to use the SDK to manipulate with the
Portal with the following sections:

* [Introduction](./portal.md)
* [Terms and Functions](./terms_functions.md)
* [Shield](./shield.md)
* [UnShield](./unshield.md)
