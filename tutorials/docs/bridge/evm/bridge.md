# Ethereum/Binance Smart Chain Bridges
The Incognito side-chain can be attached to any blockchain to conduct confidential asset transfer — this time, we consider Ethereum/Binance Smart Chain. The Incognito network runs parallel to main blockchains, allowing for secure two-way transfers of crypto assets whenever privacy is needed.
Incognito has implemented an Incognito-Ethereum/Incognito-BSC/Incognito-Polygon bridges — designed for fully decentralized cross-chain interoperability. Implementations will enable cross-chain communication between the two blockchains, and enable the choice of “incognito mode” for transfers of crypto assets (ETH/BSC/Polygon or EVM for short; and ERC20/BEP20/Polygon ERC20(PLG20) or EVM20 for short) tokens). 
Using these bridges, anyone can turn on privacy for their tokens and shield their balances and activity.
